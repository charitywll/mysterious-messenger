# Using the Chatroom Spreadsheet

Included with the program is a spreadsheet called `Script Generator.xlsx`. This sheet can make writing dialogue easier. The first tab in the spreadsheet is called **Chatroom Instructions** and explains how the **CHATROOM TEMPLATE** tab is used. As much as possible, the spreadsheet will try to check off the correct boxes for you and notify you when you've made a mistake like typing a character's name wrong.

The tab **tutorial_6_meeting** also has examples right from the corresponding .rpy file of how the dialogue for that chatroom was written using the spreadsheet.

In general, you should create a copy of the **CHATROOM TEMPLATE** tab, then fill it in with your desired dialogue. Don't forget that messages such as *707 has entered the chatroom* are handled with function calls -- see [[Useful Chatroom Functions]] for more.

Once you're happy with your chatroom and want to try it out, look at [[Setting up Sequential Chatrooms]] to see how to get the chatroom to show up in the program.
