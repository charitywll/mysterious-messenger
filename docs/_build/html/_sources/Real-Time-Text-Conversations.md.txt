# Real-Time Text Conversations

**Example files to look at: [tutorial_3_text_message.rpy](https://github.com/shawna-p/mysterious-messenger/blob/master/game/tutorial_day_scripts/tutorial_3_text_message.rpy "tutorial_3_text_message")**

Unlike regular text messages, real-time text conversations play out similar to a chatroom with a single character. The player receives a text message, and upon entering the conversation, cannot leave until either the conversation is over or the player exits the conversation and it is lost. See [[Regular Text Messages]] for more information on regular text messages instead.
