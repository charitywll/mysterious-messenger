# Writing an Email Chain

**Example files to look at: [tutorial_2_emails.rpy](https://github.com/shawna-p/mysterious-messenger/blob/v2.2.1-docs/game/tutorial_day_scripts/tutorial_2_emails.rpy "tutorial_2_emails")**

First, go to [tutorial_2_emails.rpy](https://github.com/shawna-p/mysterious-messenger/blob/v2.2.1-docs/game/tutorial_day_scripts/tutorial_2_emails.rpy "tutorial_2_emails") and scroll to the bottom, where there is a template email guest. Copy this code and follow the instructions given to create your email chain. There is a guest used in the program (@rainbow) that is defined above the email template as well, so you can see how that guest works.

You must be careful to name your reply labels correctly. The labels are case-sensitive, and if you make a mistake, the program will run into an error when you try to reply to the email.
