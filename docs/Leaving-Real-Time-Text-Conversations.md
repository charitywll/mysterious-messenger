# Leaving Real-Time Text Conversations

Unlike regular text messages, real-time text conversations function more like chatrooms. Thus, if the player clicks the "Back" button during a real-time text conversation, they will be asked if they'd like to end the conversation.

**Backing out of a real-time text conversation means that conversation will no longer be available to continue**, though the player will retain any heart points or CGs they collected before they exited the conversation. There is no option to "replay" text message conversations, but unlike chatrooms they do not expire until another text conversation overwrites them.
